"""``/api/v1/posts/*`` — create, read, update, schedule, cancel.

Every write path:

1. Enforces HTTP-level rate limits (per-key, per-workspace, global).
2. Replays the response if an idempotency key matches an earlier request.
3. Checks workspace permission via the shared ``@require_permission`` helper.
4. Validates the target ``SocialAccount`` is in the key's allowlist.
5. Checks per-platform 24h quota.
6. Calls the composer service layer (single source of truth for state).
7. Writes an audit log row.
8. Persists the response under the idempotency key if one was passed.

This ordering means an expensive operation (the create) can't run until
both the cheap rate-limit check and the issuer-permission check pass —
defence against spending DB cycles for unauthorized callers.
