"""Composer service helpers.

Where reusable "build me a post" logic lives so it can be called from the
HTMX-driven composer view *and* from the Agent API without duplicating
state-machine semantics.

The Phase 1 helper ``sync_post_scheduled_at`` keeps ``Post.scheduled_at``
in sync with the earliest per-platform ``PlatformPost.scheduled_at``;
the Phase 2 additions wrap ``Post`` + ``PlatformPost`` creation and
status transitions so audit + idempotency live in one place.

    Three cases:

    * Some children have a ``scheduled_at`` → set parent to the min.
    * No children have a ``scheduled_at`` AND parent has one cached →
      clear the parent so listings, calendars, and Coalesce fallbacks
      don't keep showing the post as scheduled. This branch covers the
      "agent cancels the last scheduled child" flow — without it,
      ``Post.scheduled_at`` lingered at the old value and the post
      kept appearing as scheduled in the UI.
    * No children, parent already null → no-op.

    A post that gains a committed schedule also drops any draft-stage
    ``proposed_publish_at``: this is the chokepoint the scheduling paths flow
    through (``create_post``, ``transition_platform_post`` for the REST
    ``/schedule`` route and the MCP ``schedule_draft`` tool, and the PATCH
    re-time which calls this after saving), so the suggestion and a real
    schedule never coexist. The ``scheduled_at`` aggregate logic is unchanged —
    the publisher's ``Coalesce(scheduled_at, post__scheduled_at)`` fallback
    depends on it — so only the proposal clear is added here. The one path that
    commits a child WITHOUT a ``scheduled_at`` (the composer's per-account chip
    endpoint) clears the proposal itself rather than routing through here, to
    avoid disturbing that aggregate.

    this in a follow-up; for now both code paths coexist and only the
    API uses it.

    Contract:

    * ``status`` must be one of ``draft`` or ``scheduled``. Other
      states (``approved``, ``publishing``, …) are produced only via
      explicit transitions through ``transition_platform_post``.
    * If ``status='scheduled'``, ``scheduled_at`` is required and must
      be in the future. The publisher polls every ~15 s; a past
      ``scheduled_at`` is accepted and will fire on the very next tick,
      but the caller almost certainly meant "now-ish" so we leave the
      decision to them.
    * ``proposed_publish_at`` is an optional draft-stage suggestion. It is
      stored as-is regardless of ``status`` and carries no future-time
      requirement — it never reaches the publisher.
    * ``social_account.workspace_id`` must equal ``workspace.id``. The
      caller (auth class / view) already enforced scope, but we
      double-check here so anyone reaching the service directly can't
      bypass it.
    * Media assets are attached in order by their position in
      ``media_asset_ids``. They must already live in the workspace's
      media library.
